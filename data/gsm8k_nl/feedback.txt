Q: Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?
Explain your reasoning step by step. Your final answer should be a single numerical number, in the form \\boxed{answer}, at the end of your response.

Step 1: Kelly spends $10 in total for 5 packs of bacon.
Step 2: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, which is 2 x $10 = $20.
Step 3: The price of 3 packs of strawberries is $4.
Step 4: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2.
Step 5: The total amount spent is $10 (bacon) + $20 (chicken) + $4 (strawberries) + $2 (apples) = $36.
Step 6: Kelly's budget is $65, so the amount left in her budget is $65 - $36 = $29.
Step 7: The answer is $\\boxed{29}.

• Step 2: Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, not the total cost of bacon. So we need to calculate the cost of one pack of bacon first (total bags of bacon / total cost) and use that.
• Step 3: The cost is per pack! So total cost should be 3 * $4, not $4.
• Step 4: The total apple cost should be (strawberry_cost / 2) * num_apple_packs. [END]

Q: Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. Calculate the cost of buying each cup.
Explain your reasoning step by step. Your final answer should be a single numerical number, in the form \\boxed{answer}, at the end of your response.

Step 1: Twenty dozen cups is 20 cups.
Step 2: Half a dozen plates is 6 / 2 = 3 plates.
Step 3: The total cost of the plates is 3 x $6000 = $18,000.
Step 4: The total cost for the cups is $1200 less than the cost of the plates, so it's $18,000 + $1200 = $19,200.
Step 5: To find the cost of each cup, divide the total cost by the number of cups: $19,200 / 20 = $960.
Step 6: The answer is $\\boxed{960} per cup.

If there are any issues with the answer provided, please identify these errors in the reasoning steps.

• Step 1: There are twenty *dozen* cups, not twenty cups. So the number of cups should be 20 * 12 = 240.
• Step 2: A dozen plates have 12 in total so half a dozen plates should have 12 / 2 = 6 ones, not 3.
• Step 3: Since the number of plates obtained in Step 2 in incorrect, the cost should be 6 x $6000, not 3 x $6000.
• Step 4: Wrong! The cost of the cups is $1200 *less* than the cost of a plate, which should be $6000 - $1200 = $4800.  [END]

Q: Randy has 60 mango trees on his farm. He also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?	
Explain your reasoning step by step. Your final answer should be a single numerical number, in the form \\boxed{answer}, at the end of your response.

Step 1: Randy has 60 mango trees.
Step 2: Half the number of mango trees is 60 / 2 = 30 trees.
Step 3: Randy has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees, which is 30 - 5 = 25 coconut trees.
Step 4: The total number of trees on Randy's farm is the sum of mango and coconut trees, which is 60 (mango) + 25 (coconut) = 85 trees.
Step 5: The answer is \\boxed{85} trees.

If there are any issues with the answer provided, please identify these errors in the reasoning steps.
