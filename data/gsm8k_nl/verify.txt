Question: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?

Solution:
Step 1: Betty needs $100 to buy the wallet.
Step 2: Her parents gave her $15, which is half of the remaining amount.
Step 3: Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, which is 2 x $15 = $30.
Step 4: The total amount of money Betty has now is $15 + $30 = $45.
Step 5: The difference between the amount she needs and the amount she has is $100 - $45 = $55.
Step 6: Betty still needs $55 to buy the wallet.
Step 7: The answer is \\boxed{$55}.

The solution is **incorrect**. You've ignored the original amount that Betty had saved, which is half the wallet's cost ($100/2 = $50). So, before receiving money from her parents and grandparents, she already had $50. [END]

Question: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?

Solution:
Step 1: Betty needs $100 to buy the wallet, but she currently has only half of the money, which is $50.
Step 2: Her parents gave her $15, so she now has $50 + $15 = $65.
Step 3: Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so she received $15 x 2 = $30 from her grandparents.
Step 4: Betty now has a total of $65 + $30 = $95.
Step 5: To find out how much more money Betty needs, subtract the amount she has from the amount she needs, which is $100 - $95 = $5.
Step 6: The answer is \\boxed{5} dollars.

This solution is **correct**. Betty only needs $5 more to buy the $100 wallet. This is because she started with $50, received $15 from her parents, and received $30 from her grandparents, which totals $95. Subtracting that from the total cost of the wallet leaves her with needing just $5. [END]

Question: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?

Solution:
Step 1: Maria wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes.
Step 2: The cost of the canvas is three times the cost of the brushes, so the cost of the canvas is 3 x $20 = $60.
Step 3: Maria needs at least 5 liters of paint, and the cost of the paint is $8 per liter, so the total cost of the paint is 5 x $8 = $40.
Step 4: The total cost of the materials Maria needs is $60 + $40 = $100.
Step 5: If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $100 = $100.
Step 6: The answer is \\boxed{100}.

The solution is **incorrect**. You missed to add the cost of the brushes in the total cost of the materials. Maria not only wants to buy canvas and paint, but also a set of brushes for $20. [END]

Step 2: The cost of canvas = 3 x $20 = $60.
Step 3: Maria needs at least 5 liters of paint, and each liter costs $8. Therefore, the total cost of paint = 5 x $8 = $40.
Step 4: Total cost = $20 + $60 + $40 = $120.
Step 5: Maria wants to sell the painting for $200, so the profit she will make = $200 - $120 = $80.
Step 6: The answer is \\boxed{$80}.

The solution is **correct**. Maria has to spend $120 on brushes, canvas, and paint. She sells the painting for $200. So, the profit she makes is $200 - $120 = $80. [END]
