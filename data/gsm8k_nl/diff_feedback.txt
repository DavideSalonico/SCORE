Q: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?

Answer 1 (Incorrect):
Step 1: Betty needs $100 to buy the wallet.
Step 2: Her parents gave her $15, which is half of the remaining amount.
Step 3: Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, which is 2 x $15 = $30.
Step 4: The total amount of money Betty has now is $15 + $30 = $45.
Step 5: The difference between the amount she needs and the amount she has is $100 - $45 = $55.
Step 6: Betty still needs $55 to buy the wallet.
Step 7: The answer is \\boxed{$55}.

Answer 2 (Correct):
Step 1: Betty needs $100 to buy the wallet, but she currently has only half of the money, which is $50.
Step 2: Her parents gave her $15, so she now has $50 + $15 = $65.
Step 3: Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so she received $15 x 2 = $30 from her grandparents.
Step 4: Betty now has a total of $65 + $30 = $95.
Step 5: To find out how much more money Betty needs, subtract the amount she has from the amount she needs, which is $100 - $95 = $5.
Step 6: The answer is \\boxed{5} dollars.

Let's go through the errors in Answer 1 and provide feedback:

Answer 1 (Incorrect):
Step 1: Betty needs $100 to buy the wallet.
Feedback: This step is correct.

Step 2: Her parents gave her $15, which is half of the remaining amount.
Feedback: This is incorrect. Betty's parents gave her $15, but it's not necessarily half of the remaining amount. The question states that Betty has only half of the money she needs, not half of the remaining amount after her parents' contribution.

Step 3: Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, which is 2 x $15 = $30.
Feedback: This step is correct.

Step 4: The total amount of money Betty has now is $15 + $30 = $45.
Feedback: This is incorrect. The correct calculation should be $15 (from parents) + $30 (from grandparents) = $45, but this is not the total amount Betty has. The correct total should include the initial amount Betty had, which is half of the money she needs ($100), making the correct total $45 + $50 = $95.

Step 5: The difference between the amount she needs and the amount she has is $100 - $45 = $55.
Feedback: This is incorrect. The correct calculation should be $100 - $95 (the total amount Betty has) = $5.

Step 6: Betty still needs $55 to buy the wallet.
Feedback: This is incorrect based on the corrected calculations. Betty actually needs $5 more to buy the wallet.

Step 7: The answer is \\boxed{$55}.
Feedback: The correct answer, based on the corrected calculations, should be \\boxed{$5}. [END]

Q: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?

Answer 1 (Incorrect):
Step 1: Maria wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes.
Step 2: The cost of the canvas is three times the cost of the brushes, so the cost of the canvas is 3 x $20 = $60.
Step 3: Maria needs at least 5 liters of paint, and the cost of the paint is $8 per liter, so the total cost of the paint is 5 x $8 = $40.
Step 4: The total cost of the materials Maria needs is $60 + $40 = $100.
Step 5: If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $100 = $100.
Step 6: The answer is \\boxed{100}.

Answer 2 (Correct):
Step 1: Maria needs a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes.
Step 2: The cost of canvas = 3 x $20 = $60.
Step 3: Maria needs at least 5 liters of paint, and each liter costs $8. Therefore, the total cost of paint = 5 x $8 = $40.
Step 4: Total cost = $20 + $60 + $40 = $120.
Step 5: Maria wants to sell the painting for $200, so the profit she will make = $200 - $120 = $80.
Step 6: The answer is \\boxed{$80}.

Feedback: This step is correct.

Step 4: The total cost of the materials Maria needs is $60 + $40 = $100.
Feedback: This step adds the calculated costs of canvas and paint, but it's incorrect. The correct calculation should include the cost of brushes as well, making the total cost $20 (brushes) + $60 (canvas) + $40 (paint) = $120.

Step 5: If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $100 = $100.
Feedback: This calculation uses the incorrect total cost ($100) instead of the corrected total cost ($120). Therefore, the result is incorrect.

Step 6: The answer is \\boxed{100}.
Feedback: The correct answer, based on the corrected calculations, should be \\boxed{$80} as shown in Answer 2. [END]
