Let's go through the errors in Answer 1 and provide feedback:

Answer 1 (Incorrect):
Step 1: The answer must be something that contains gasoline and water.
Feedback: This step is correct.

Step 2: Of the above choices, only a gas station would contain both gasoline and water.
Feedback: This is incorrect. Gas stations typically have underground storage tanks for gasoline and do not have water mixed with gasoline in their systems. This is an error as it does not address the presence of water. The correct identification should involve a scenario where water and gasoline can be present together. Boats are a more appropriate choice as they often use gasoline engines, and there's a possibility of gasoline being in the water around them due to spills or leaks.

Step 3: So the answer is (A).
Feedback: The correct answer, based on Answer 2, should be (E). [END]

Let's go through the errors in Answer 1 and provide feedback:

Answer 1 (Incorrect):
Step 1: The answer must be the goal of the two conglomerates reaching a tentative agreement.
Feedback: This step is correct.

Step 2: Of the above choices, only making progress makes sense as a goal of reaching a tentative agreement.
Feedback: The analysis here is incorrect. The conclusion that making progress makes sense as a goal of reaching a tentative agreement is too general and could apply to nearly any agreement. Additionally, making progress is not a specific action that would be the subject of a typical business agreement. Hence, 'doing business' as an answer choice aligns better with typical business agreements, which are generally about partnerships, mergers, acquisitions, sales, or collaborationsâ€”specific activities rather than abstract concepts like "making progress".

Step 3: So the answer is (D).
Feedback: The correct answer should be (A). [END]
