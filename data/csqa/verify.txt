Is this solution correct or not? Answer **correct** or **incorrect** and explain your reasoning. End your response with [END].
===
The solution is **correct**. In the context of the question, the scenario of "gasoline in the water" suggests the presence of gasoline in close proximity to water, implying a potential for the gasoline to mix with or enter the water. Boats are the most likely of the options provided to have this occurrence because they operate on the water and may sometimes leak fuel, leading to gasoline being found in the water. Therefore, (E) boat is the correct answer. [END]
