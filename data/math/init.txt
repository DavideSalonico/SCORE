Q: The sum of two numbers is 6. The difference of their squares is 12. What is the positive difference of the two numbers?
Explain your reasoning step by step. Your final answer should be a single numerical number, in the form \\boxed{answer}. End your response with [END].
===
Step 1: Call the two numbers $x$ and $y$. 
Step 2: We are given that $x+y = 6$ and $x^2 - y^2 = 12$. 
Step 3: $x^2 - y^2$ factors into $(x+y)(x-y)$. 
Step 4: We can substitute in for $x+y$, giving $6(x-y) = 12$.
Step 5: $x-y = \boxed{2}$, so the answer is \\boxed{2}. [END]

Q: Which integer is closest to the cube root of 100?
Explain your reasoning step by step. Your final answer should be a single numerical number, in the form \\boxed{answer}. End your response with [END].
===
Step 1: Either 4 or 5 is closest to $\sqrt[3]{100}$, since $4^3=64$ and $5^3=125$.  
Step 2: Since $4.5^3=91.125<100$, $\sqrt[3]{100}$ is closer to $\boxed{5}$ than to 4.
Step 3: The answer is \\boxed{5}. [END]

Q: A scale drawing of a park shows that one inch represents 800 feet. A line segment in the drawing that is 4.75 inches long represents how many feet?
Explain your reasoning step by step. Your final answer should be a single numerical number, in the form \\boxed{answer}. End your response with [END].
===
Step 1: Each inch of the 4.75-inch line segment represents 800 feet. 
Step 2: So the whole line segment represents $4.75\times800=\frac{19}{4}\cdot800=19\cdot200=\boxed{3800}$ feet.
Step 3: The answer is \\boxed{3800}. [END]

Q: How many multiples of 10 are between 9 and 101?
Explain your reasoning step by step. Your final answer should be a single numerical number, in the form \\boxed{answer}. End your response with [END].
===
Step 1: Multiples of 10 are numbers that can be expressed as $10n$, where n is an integer.
Step 2: The smallest multiple of 10 greater than 9 is 10 (where $n=1$).
Step 3: The largest multiple of 10 less than 101 is 100 (where $n=10$).
Step 4: We can find the number of multiples of 10 between 10 and 100 by listing them: 10, 20, 30, ..., 100.
Step 5: Counting, we get: $10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100$, which gives us 10 multiples.
Step 6: Thus, there are $\boxed{10}$ multiples of 10 between 9 and 101.
Step 7: The answer is \\boxed{10}. [END]
